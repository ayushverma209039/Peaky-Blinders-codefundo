Floods are the most common and widespread of all natural disasters. Flood is one of the most dangerous natural disasters that occur frequently and can affect large community areas. It has become the main threat to people's lives and properties. Because of this reason, accurate flood prediction is very much needed to provide early warning to residents nearby flood locations so that the area can be evacuated as early as possible and the damage to life and property can be minimized.

Currently, hydrological models are used to get the prediction of flood water levels. However, we want to predict the flood with various parameters like weather forecasts, amount of rainfall, temperature and hydreological maps. Such models are difficult to develop since they involve complex system such as the dynamic of flood water level. Flood water level fluctuate in a non-linear way, thus it is very difficult to predict the flood water level.
