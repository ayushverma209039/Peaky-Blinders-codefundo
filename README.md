Floods are the most common and widespread of all natural disasters. Flood is one of the most dangerous natural disasters that occur frequently and can affect large community areas. It has become the main threat to people's lives and properties. Because of this reason, accurate flood prediction is very much needed to provide early warning to residents nearby flood locations so that the area can be evacuated as early as possible and the damage to life and property can be minimized.
